Written down thoughts to remember stuff:

- test build with c++17 again now that dependencies are properly made
- THEN change to use c++20
- added assets from bamboo release file for testing - must make it seperate download in the future

- must figure out how to create editor executable seperate from user developer code
- must figure out how to update models in editor, through another program 
- must figure out how to contain an ENTIRE scene inside of a container of some kind (like zip or something)
- For example, show what the model looks like in-game with the editor, but then change it with blender, and once the file changes, the editor updates the model
- use blender to create very simple test assets
- samples from here as well: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/blob/main/Models/Models.md


- editor/simulation/simulation_ui is where we call the sky texture
- asset_manager.h also is where DEFAULT_TEXTURE_CUBE_URL which has the tex and texc file calls
- config folder has a .yaml file that controls locations of the default world
- filter_cube_pass.cpp calls for default cube static mesh

- consider adding https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-IBL-Sampler later
- engine was supposed to generate bdrf, but never got the chance due to bdrf not existing (I believe that was a bug)

- VALVE'S FOSSILIZE IS GOOD: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Fossilize

- Create hash when serializing model or textures, then compare that hash with a new hash when you make edits to the model file
- Wait a minute, the current serialization system is amazing, the only problem being that it is inflexible
- The only changes needing to be made is to just save the name path of the original model/texture 
- Then combine together for exporting

- Entity
    - Component 1
    - Component 2

- Add more functionality to editor GUI 
- Must create a variable for assets to store original file names (like *.gltf, *.glb, *.png, e.t.c) 
- Then create an export function that packages together assets from the original file type
- Test and then finally package together 0.1.0

- Json
    - Name of original asset (.glb, or .png, e.t.c) 
    - All paths to serialized assets of model/texture
    - when we need to export, we just open all of the assets and then make the appropriate file

- C# as a technically scripting language - need to compile, but compiles very fast

- Allow importing or adding of assets/files into the engine without drag and drop (spawns item in default (0.0f, 0.0f, .0f))
- unless there is already an item, in that case it will spawn on top of the existing item, with the highest vertex as a reference

- IMGUI COLORS ARE TOO BRIGHT BECAUSE OF SHADERS
- IMGUI VULKAN uses a differently labelled shader values (which I added instructions for in this project in case I forget)
- Not sure if bamboo engine modified IMGUI with this shader or if IMGUI originally had this and changed it 
- must check later (probably the former though)
- compare IMGUI vulkan shader code to the one in bamboo to see if there were changes
- due to imgui changes, document code soon

- figure out how to use that shader code without modifying IMGUI vulkan (if possible) 
- also considering changing imguizmo to show the axis stuff all the time? I mean, current system is still theoretically better since less clutter

- PRIORITY IS EXPORT OPTIONS
- After that, ADD C#

- NOTE: property_ui should be providing an option to attach a component, the problem being that one of the main reasons to do so would be to attach scripts, which I do not have rn
- It might finally be time to do so tomorrow
- Remember to create template C# code so that they can start with something

- Must create hash for each model or texture. That way, I can make edits to each thing in something like gimp or blender, and then the program will auto update the model in the editor. 
- Editor will check if the hash for an asset is different, and if so, it will import and update
- Editor mode will also keep track of the original assets


- I AM TRYING TO REPLACE RTTR WITH meta.hpp
- For the loop part in property_ui that trys to modify a vector member, I think I might have to create a method for each class with a vector I need to modify
- This method will take in a uvalue, convert it to the appropriate type after processing, and then that element in the vector will be changed
- should probably make it have a parameter of like an index and then the uvalue that will be modifying it or something.
- Point being is that it shouldn't be too hard, just might take a little while
- Must make an overrideable function in component (maybe in entity as well), and then try to proceed?


- You want a folder with 6 images (.exr, .png, .jpg, .e.tc...)
