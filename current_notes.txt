- test build with c++17 again now that dependencies are properly made
- THEN change to use c++20
- added assets from bamboo release file for testing - must make it seperate download in the future
- must convert glfw code to sdl2
- must figure out how to create editor executable seperate from user developer code

- editor/simulation/simulation_ui is where we call the sky texture
- asset_manager.h also is where DEFAULT_TEXTURE_CUBE_URL which has the tex and texc file calls
- config folder has a .yaml file that controls locations of the default world
- asset_manager is where the .world is attempted to be loaded, but fails due to being incompatible

- Program works with a ktx2 cubemap file
- Generate with command below
- You want a folder with 6 images (.exr, .png, .jpg, .e.tc...) with images labelled in the following fashion (extension is an example):
- right.png left.png top.png bottom.png front.png back.png
- NOTE: engine only works with .exr made skyboxes for now; raw 16-bit (or higher) image files

FOR GENERATING DEFAULT SKYBOX - DO INSIDE FOLDER
ktx create --format R16G16B16A16_SFLOAT --generate-mipmap --cubemap *.exr default_skybox.ktx
ktx create --format R8G8B8A8_SRGB --generate-mipmap --cubemap *.png default_skybox.ktx
