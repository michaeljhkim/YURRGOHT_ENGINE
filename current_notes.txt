- test build with c++17 again now that dependencies are properly made
- THEN change to use c++20
- added assets from bamboo release file for testing - must make it seperate download in the future
- must convert glfw code to sdl2
- must figure out how to create editor executable seperate from user developer code

- editor/simulation/simulation_ui is where we call the sky texture
- asset_manager.h also is where DEFAULT_TEXTURE_CUBE_URL which has the tex and texc file calls
- config folder has a .yaml file that controls locations of the default world
- asset_manager is where the .world is attempted to be loaded, but fails due to being incompatible

- PROBLEM: cannot open default .world files made by bamboo due to namespaces being different
- FIX: figure out how 1 world is made, then create a function (or class) that constructs that default world. Just enough to get started
- Make it a function so that I can make new default worlds in case I need to make bigger changes
- Eventually make it so that this function can be called through editor ui
- For now, comment it out after feature is finished

- TO TRY TOMORROW: I don't think a .world is created on init, but I will have to check
