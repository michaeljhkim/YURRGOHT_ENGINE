- Docker will be used to install dependencies according to their own needs
- CMakeLists need to be changed to remove all local dependencies (except for imgui - worry about later)
- I can also just add vma (vulkan memory allocator) because its just a header file
- need to remove install instructions and such
- test build with c++17 again now that dependencies are properly made

- THEN change to use c++20
- may need to revert some code back to original if this works as well as I think (so I can have a good starting point)


- Delete Local dependencies:
- cereal
- glfw
- glm
- jolt
- rttr
- sdl2
- spdlog
- yaml-cpp

- Keep Local dependencies:
- eventpp
- imgui
- ktx       (TRYING TO ADD TO DOCKER - figure out why the rpm will just not install)
- random    (TRYING TO ADD TO DOCKER)
- tinygltf
- vma


# Vulkan KTX2 dependency
RUN wget https://github.com/KhronosGroup/KTX-Software/releases/download/v4.3.2/KTX-Software-4.3.2-Linux-x86_64.rpm && \
    dnf localinstall --nobest -y KTX-Software-4.3.2-Linux-x86_64.rpm


- Consider copying the original bamboo source code again for clean start with docker
