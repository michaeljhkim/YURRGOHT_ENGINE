- test build with c++17 again now that dependencies are properly made
- THEN change to use c++20
- added assets from bamboo release file for testing - must make it seperate download in the future
- must convert glfw code to sdl2
- must figure out how to create editor executable seperate from user developer code

- The Test executable technically works, but it seg faults right away
- first guess is environment differences


- Keep Local dependencies:
- imgui
- tinygltf
